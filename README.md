Smart Data Science is an interactive application developed with Streamlit that leverages the OpenAI API to generate content related to data science. The application allows users to create technical summaries, generate Python code, and obtain customized datasets easily and efficiently.


**Features**

- **Technical Summaries Generation:** Provides clear and concise summaries on specific data science topics, including practical examples. This feature is ideal for quickly understanding complex concepts such as clustering analysis, deep neural networks, data visualization, and algorithm optimization. Users can input a topic and receive a well-structured summary that can be downloaded as a Word document.

- **Python Code Generation:** Creates efficient Python code snippets for various tasks. Whether you need to create visualizations, connect to SQL databases, perform web scraping, or build a basic REST API with FastAPI, this feature generates the necessary code based on your description. The generated code can be directly copied or downloaded for immediate use in your projects.

- **Dataset Generation:** Generates customized datasets in CSV format with headers and at least 100 rows, suitable for analysis and modeling. Users can specify the type of dataset they need, such as sales data for 2024, e-commerce customer data, regional demographic data, or historical cryptocurrency prices. The application then creates a dataset that can be downloaded and used for various data science tasks.

**Technologies Used**

- **Streamlit:** A framework for creating interactive web applications in Python.

- **OpenAI API:** Used to generate content via the GPT-4 model.

- **Python Libraries:** docx, pandas, dotenv, io for document manipulation, data handling, and environment variable management.

- **st_social_media_links:** A component for adding social media links to the application.

**Usage**

- **Technical Summaries:** Enter a data science topic and get a detailed technical summary.

- **Python Code:** Describe the code you need and generate ready-to-use Python code snippets.
  
- **Datasets:** Specify the type of dataset you need and download an automatically generated CSV file.
